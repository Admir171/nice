    **Rules:**
    
    - Set a timer for 3‚Äì5 minutes per turn.
    - The roller must do the full action unless they ‚Äúpass,‚Äù in which case the partner decides a playful "penalty" (e.g., strip an item of clothing, give a compliment, etc.).
    - Add your own house rules or customize the list to your taste or comfort level.
